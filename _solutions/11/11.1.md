Unsigned integers cannot hold values that are less than 0 and so the exit condition of this for loop will never be met.

In addition, the format specifier `%d` is for signed decimal integers and can be replaced with `%u` assuming the resolution of the first issue does not involve changing the type of integer we are using in the iteration.
